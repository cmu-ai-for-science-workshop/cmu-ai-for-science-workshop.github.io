# Welcome to CMU Agent Workshop 2024

<Image src={cover} alt="GHC building at CMU."/>
 
You are invited to join a two-day workshop on the various designs, applications, challenges, and risks of agents.

It will feature [invited talks](/2024/speakers), [tutorials](/2024/tutorials), [student research posters](/2024/posters), [seminars](/2024/social_agent) and a [hackathon](/2024/hackathon)!

## Present Your Project, big or small!
**Attention students! If you have a project (course project, ongoing research, fun side project, or startup projects, anything really!) about LLMs, tools and agents, come join and chat with others both inside and outside CMU in our poster session!**
