# Socially Intelligent Agents Seminar
## Call for participants

As more capable social agents, from chatbots, to virtual task-automation agents, to physical robots, begin to be deployed in the real world, we start to see the various challenges of them interacting and communicating with real users. Some of these are actually shared among all different domains, but the research findings are often only circulated within their respective fields. This seminar is a unique opportunity to talk with researchers outside of your field. We are interested in the topics including but not limited to:

- **Text-based agents (e.g. ChatGPT), virtual agents (e.g. Web browser agents), embodied agents (e.g. Minecraft agents), and physical robots**, that interact with each other or with humans.
- The **environment** in which these agents operate: text world, the web, games, physical world, etc.
- The **interaction** between these agents and humans: collaboration, competition, shared autonomy, etc. 
- The **evaluation** of these agents: user studies, model-based evaluation, and objective metrics.
- The **applications** of these agents: healthcare, education, entertainment, art creation, science discovery, law, policy, etc.
- The **concerns** of these agents: safety, privacy, long-term risks, etc.

### What you would expect 

1. An *overview* of [the papers](https://sotopia-lab.github.io/awesome-social-agents/paper_table) on the topics mentioned above.
2. A *discussion session* where you can share the various challenges you have noticed in your research and hear from others about their challenges.
3. A *breakout session* where you will engage in small group discussions on one of the challenges that you are interested in.
4. An *opportunity* to contribute to an on-going survey and be a co-author of the publication.
